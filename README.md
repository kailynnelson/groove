# groove
Let this app reorganize a Spotify playlist for you, based on its songs' danceability scores.

Live at [groove.pub](http://groove.pub/) &#x2197;

## why groove?
When I found out that Spotify scores the "danceability" of songs, I wanted to create an app that would organize my songs by their danceability. 

It uses a series of functions to plot songs along a two-peaked sine wave by their danceability scores (shout-out to my partner for giving me a boost with this). 

Eventually, this app will let you define the type of wave you want your playlist to follow, and it will organize a playlist accordingly. 

## currently working on
Revamping the project from the first attempt. I got confused about how to publish the site and wanted to restart and KISS.

Also need to get a grip on what the [Spotify API's Authorization](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/) &#x2197; process is doing.
